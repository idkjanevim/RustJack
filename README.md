# Pong-Rust
A blackjack game made with rust and Bevy game engine.

## Description
I used Bevy(Rust game engine) and made blackjack game.
First you input your bet and press **ENTER** to confirm. By pressing **SPACE** you can "hit" (Take card) and by pressing **ENTER**
you can "stand" (Stop your turn). After that the dealer takes cards untill they have more then 16 points.
